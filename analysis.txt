After login when you open any course page. The following cookies are passed with request:
coach_visitor_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;
sidebar-active=true;
__distillery=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;
_ga=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;
_gid=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;
_coach_session=xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Response:
_coach_session=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
new value of _coach_session cookie is returned with each response but nothing happens if I pass old value to next request. So ignoring for now.
