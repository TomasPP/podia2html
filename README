Java tool for educational personal purposes to convert podia.com hosted specific course (heavy on the text with some images).
Tool converts multiple pages to a one html that can be later converted to the e-book format with Calibre.

Tool tested only for one course so it might not suit for other courses
or podia.com might introduce major changes in pages HTML that will brake functionality.

Tool does not convert image tags to point to local images. For this open in Chrome output html and do 'Save as' to save page with images locally.
